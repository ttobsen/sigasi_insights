In addition to syntax validation, Sigasi Studio also checks your code for
semantic problems (**Linting**, or **Linter checks**). Some of these
problems can be automatically resolved with **Quick Fixes**. Both syntax
checking and linting happen at type-time: new markers appear *as you are
typing* your code.

# Marker Icons {: #linting-icons}

* ![](icons/info.png) marks an info message.
* ![](icons/warning_lightbulb.png) marks a warning that can be resolved automatically with a Quick Fix.
* ![](icons/warning.png) marks a warning that cannot be resolved automatically.
* ![](icons/error_lightbulb.png) marks an error that can be resolved automatically with a Quick Fix.
* ![](icons/error.png) marks an error that cannot be resolved automatically.

# Linting {: #linting-linting}

VHDL code **Lint** is defined as code that is strictly correct according
to the language definition, but still suspicious or problematic.
Sigasi Studio has a built-in VHDL linter, which provides info about code lint
in the design. Sigasi Studio’s VHDL linter checks for the following problems:

* Unused declarations
* Duplicate declarations
* Declaration could not be found
* VHDL 2008 features in VHDL 93 mode (Learn about [choosing your VHDL version][/manual/config#configure-version])
* Assignment validation
* Case statement validation
* Instantiation statement validation
* Component validation (Entity/Component mismatch)
* Library validation
* Range validation
* Deprecated and non-standard packages
* Duplicate, conflicting design unit names
* Missing return statement in function bodies
* Missing, unnecessary and duplicate signals in the sensitivity list
* Port, signal, variable, constant or generic declarations that are never read or written
* Invalid port associations (incompatible port modes in instantiations)
* Order of generic and port associations
* [Consistent capitalization of identifiers](#capitalization-of-identifiers)
* Advanced Configuration validation (component mismatch, missing binding, ...)
* Redundant boolean equality expressions (`boolean = true`)

## No Linting for Common Libraries {: #linting-common-libraries}

Common Libraries are considered to be production ready libraries.
Linting is skipped for all files in the Common Libraries folder.

## Quick Fixes {: #linting-quick-fix}

Some of the VHDL lint problems can be automatically resolved with
*Quick Fixes*. These problems have *markers* annotated with a lightbulb
icon (like ![](icons/warning\_lightbulb.png)). To trigger
a Quick Fix, click the problem marker or press **Ctrl-1** and select the
Quick Fix.

* Remove unused declaration
* Declare signals and constants
* Switch to VHDL 2008 mode
* Correct signal/variable assignment operator
* Ignore deprecated libraries
* Configure Altera, Xilinx, ModelSim and VUnit libraries
* Declare missing enumeration literal in case statements
* Add missing when clause in case statements
* Correct attribute entity class in attribute specifications
* Add missing signals to sensitivity list
* Fix capitalization of identifier to correspond to its declaration
* Match order of generic and port associations with declaration order
* Update component declaration when the entity declaration has changed

## Configuring the Severity Level {: #linting-severity-level}

The Sigasi Studio VHDL linter has reasonable defaults for the severity level of
reported lint problems. However, the severity level of certain classes
of lint is configurable for additional flexibility. The configuration
interface is available in **Window \> Preferences \> VHDL \>
Errors/Warnings**.

# List of VHDL code rules

This is the list of VHDL coding rules that can be checked automatically
by Sigasi Studio.

## Dead Code lint {: #dead-code}

Dead code is code that is does have any effect in your simulation or
synthesis. Examples of dead code are signals that are never used, or
conditions that are never triggered.

Dead code does not bother the simulator nor the synthesis tool. However,
it consumes mental energy of anybody reading the code. People will try
to figure the puropose of a given statement and it may take a while
before they realize that they are dealing with dead code. This makes it
more expensive to review code and to reuse code. In general, dead code
is a form of technological debt that should be avoided.

Sigasi Studio flags some kinds of dead code:

* unused or unnecessary library and use clauses,
* unused declarations (signals, constants, …)
* unused ports
* unreachable statements

For unused declarations, there is also a Quick Fix to help you remove
unused declarations fast.

## Deprecated IEEE Packages, Non-Standard Packages

Some packages are widely spread, but were never standardized by IEEE.
Different vendors have shipped different versions, with incompatible
implementation. These packages should not be used and are flagged as
**Deprecated IEEE packages**.

```vhdl
ieee.std_logic_arith
ieee.std_logic_signed
ieee.std_logic_unsigned
```

Instead, use the standard `ieee.numeric_std` package.

The package `ieee.std_logic_misc` has the same problem of not being standardized by IEEE. Contrary to the packages above, there is no consensus on how to replace this package.  
Sigasi Studio flags this package as **Non-standard package**.

Read more in [/tech/deprecated-ieee-libraries].

## Incomplete Port Maps and Generic Maps

Available since Sigasi 2.25

Sigasi Studio warns about port maps and generic maps that are not complete:  
**Port map is using default values. Missing optional actuals: yourport**

Input ports and generics need to be be assigned in your instantiation
statement, if they don’t already have a default value. If you don’t do
this, you are writing illegal VHDL. Sigasi Studio will mark an error, and so
will all other tools.

Input ports and generics with a default value, as well as output ports
do not need to be assigned explicitly. However, this is often not
intended. For that reason, Sigasi Studio can warn you about this.

![](images/warn-incomplete-map.png)

## Posititional Association in Instantiations

Available since Sigasi 2.30

Most VHDL designers prefer named associations in port and generic maps in instantiations. This makes it a lot easier to spot wrong connections.
By default Sigasi Studio warns when positional associations are used. You can change the severity of this check via **Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Errors/Warnings** in the **Instantiation statement valiadation** section.

## Quick Fix for Third Party Libraries

If you are using vendor libraries from Altera or Xilinx (ISE or Vivado),
you do not need to set up these libraries by hand. Sigasi Studio has a Quick Fix
to do this for you.

![](images/alteraquickfix.png)

The `library` statement that tries to import a missing library (like
`altera`) will be have a yellow warning marker next to it. Click this
marker and select **Configure library altera**. If the path tho your
Altera Quartus (or Xilinx ISE) installation is not yet set, Sigasi Studio will
ask to set the path now. You can always change these paths in **Window
\> Preferences \> Sigasi \> Toolchains**.
Note that for the Xilinx libraries we only map the packages with the
component declarations. By default all entity and architecture
declarations are not mapped (excluded). This significantly reduces the
time for a clean build. If you use direct entity instantiations, you can
easily map the entities you need.

## Redundant "others"

If a case statement contains all the possible choices (usually in an
enumerated datatype), you can safely remove the `when others` clause.
Sigasi Studio warns about this:

**Case statement contains all choices explicitly. You can safely remove
the redundant `others`.**

There is some debate on this coding rule. However, the vast majority of
synthesis tools do not take the `others` into account if all choices are
enumerated. If the synthesis tool is set up to generate fault-tolerant
hardware, the fallback state is the same as the reset state (for most
synthesis tools). Check the manual of your synthesis tools and run some
experiments.
For more information, see [/tech/vhdl-case-statements-can-do-without-others]

### Sensitivity List

VHDL requires a sensitivity list for each process (or wait statements in
the project).

Since VHDL-2008, you can write `process (all)` to make sure you have all
signals in the sensitivity list. In all earlier versions, incomplete
sensitivity lists can cause unexpected behavior. That is: your
simulation results may be different from your synthesis results. Most
synthesis tools ignore your sensitivity list. In traditional workflows,
only the synthesis warnings will give you a hint that your sensitivity
list is incomplete. This report will be available only hours or even
days after you have finished typing your code. Flagging this problem
earlier saves time and lets you catch the problem early.

Sigasi Studio can warn about problems with your sensitivity list:

* **Incomplete sensitivity list** (there is Quick Fix for this)
* **Superfluous signals in sensitivity list**
* **Duplicate signals in sensitivity list**

## Superfluous Library Clause {: superfluous-library-clause }

The VHDL language reference manual states that:

*Every design unit except package STANDARD is assumed to contain the following implicit context items as part of its context clause:*

```vhdl
    library STD, WORK;
    use STD.STANDARD.all;
```

Hence, any extra library statement that includes `STD` or `WORK` is
pointless, as is any use clause that includes `std.standard.all`. Hardly
anybody would type the use clause, but quite some people start all of
their files with two extra library clauses. Sigasi Studio flags this as
warning.

![](images/warn-superfluous-library.png)

## Dead Code (unreachable code)

If the Sigasi Studio analyzer can determine that a condition is always false,
it will mark the if-statement because it contains dead code.

![](images/unreachable_code.png)

## Null Range (empty range) {: #null-range}

In VHDL, you can use ranges with `to` and `downto`. But, if you use the
wrong direction, you get an empty range, which is usually not what you
want: `7 downto 0` is a range of eight. `7 to 0` is an null range.
We have a lint check that warns about this, even if you use constants
(or some simple arithmetic).

![](images/nullrange.png)

## Space Before the Physical Unit {: #space-physical-unit }

If you type a numeric literal with a physical unit, there should be a
space between the number and the unit.

```vhdl
    T := 25ns; -- ILLEGAL, but accepted by ModelSim
    T := 25 ns; -- OK; according to VHDL language standard
```

Mentor Graphics’ ModelSim and QuestaSim accept the former (illegal)
version. As a result, some VHDL designers got used to writing the
incorrect version, producing code that is not portable to other
simulators. Sigasi Studio accepts the ModelSim-style physical literals, but
warns about this.

## Capitalization of Identifiers

Although VHDL is not case sensitive, it is recommend to always use the same capitalization when referring to the same declaration. Since version 2.30, Sigasi Studio warns when the capitalization of a reference differs from the capitalization of the declaration. Because external libraries can have different code styles, this linting only checks references in the same library as its declaration.

Since [/releasenotes/sigasi-2.31] this can easily be fixed with a Quick Fix.

![](images/captalization_references.png)

Since [/releasenotes/sigasi-3.06] all capitalization issues in a file can be fixed in one click.

![](/releasenotes/3.6/capitalization_all.png)

## Naming Conventions

On the **Navigation conventions** preference page (**Window \>
Preferences \> Sigasi \> VHDL \> Naming conventions**) you can configure
patterns to check correct naming of your VHDL identifiers. Patterns are
configured with [Java regex syntax](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html)

Only names with a specified pattern are checked. Empty patterns are
omitted.

**Example:** to enforce a style where all variables have a `_v` suffix,
you would specify `.*_v` pattern in the **Variable name** field.

## Vector width in assignments and port maps

Sigasi Studio checks the vector size in assignments (Since [/releasenotes/sigasi-2.28]) and port maps (Since [/releasenotes/sigasi-3.01]). This check works at type-time and takes the (symbolic) value of generics into account.

## Order of assocations

Sigasi Studio gives a warning when the **order** of generics or ports in a `map` differs from the original generics or ports declaration order.

![](images/linting_vector_width.png)

## Check for component/entity mismatch

Sigasi Studio gives a warning if a component declaration is not equal to its matching entity. You can easily fix this by applying the quick fix.

![](images/linting_component_entity.png)

# Project specific Linting settings

The default way to configure the severity of the Sigasi Studio linting checks is to set their severity in the **Errors/Warnings** preference page.
You can override these setting by creating a settings file for your projects.

In each project, you can override the coding rules settings. You can override rules for the **entire project**, for **folders** in the project, or for individual **files**.

Project settings are stored in this settings file:

```text
    ${project location}/.settings/com.sigasi.hdt.vhdl.linting.prefs
```

To configure the severity of validations, add a line for each validation:

```text
    ${validation id}/severity/${path}=${severity}
```

Where `${validation id}` can be

* the number of the validation ID (e.g. 140)
* `all` to specify all validation ids in one rule

Where `${path}` can be:

* `<project>` (literally, with brackets!)  to set the severity of the entire project
* `/path/to/folder` to set the severity of an entire folder
* `/path/to/file.vhd` to set the severity of a specific file

Where `${severity}` can be:

* ERROR
* WARNING
* INFO
* IGNORE

Whitespace must be escaped with a back slash (`\`). You can add comments with `#`.

Examples:

```text
    72/severity/<project>=IGNORE
    72/severity//Folder\ name/Extra\ folder=INFO
    72/severity//test/top.vhd=WARNING
    all/severity/<project>=IGNORE
```
